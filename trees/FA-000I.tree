\p{A subset #{S} of a metric space #{(X,d)} is said to be precompact (or relatively compact) if its closure is [compact](FA-000H).}

\p{Equivalently, a set is precompact if every sequence in the set has a convergent subsequence in #{X} (though the limit might not be in the original set).}

\p{In a complete metric space, a set is precompact if and only if it is [totally bounded](FA-000O).}
