\taxon{Definition}


\p{A property is said to hold almost everywhere (abbreviated as [a.e.](FA-003S)) on a measure space #{(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)} if the set of points where the property fails has measure zero.}

\p{Formally, a property #{P} holds almost everywhere if there exists a measurable set #{N} with #{Î¼(N) = 0} such that #{P} holds for all #{x \in X \setminus N}.}

\p{This concept is fundamental in measure theory and functional analysis because it allows us to ignore sets of measure zero, which are often irrelevant for integration and other analytical purposes.}

\p{This concept is essential in Lebesgue integration theory, as functions that differ only on a set of measure zero have the same Lebesgue integral.}

\p{For example, two [measurable functions](FA-001L) #{f} and #{g} are said to be equal almost everywhere if #{\mu(\{x \in X : f(x) \neq g(x)\}) = 0}.}
