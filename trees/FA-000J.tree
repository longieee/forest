\p{A subset #{S} of a metric space #{(X,d)} is said to be bounded if there exists some number #{r} such that #{d(x,y) \leq r} for all #{x,y \in S}.}

\p{Equivalently, a set #{S} is bounded if it is contained in some ball of finite radius, i.e., if there exists #{x_0 \in X} and #{r > 0} such that #{S \subseteq B(x_0, r)}, where #{B(x_0, r)} is the ball with center #{x_0} and radius #{r}.}
