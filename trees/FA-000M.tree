\p{A subset #{S} of a topological space is sequentially compact if every sequence in #{S} has a convergent subsequence whose limit is in #{S}.}

\p{In metric spaces, sequential compactness is equivalent to compactness.}

\p{In #{\mathbb{R}^n}, a set is sequentially compact if and only if it is closed and bounded (the [Heine-Borel Theorem](FA-000P)).}
