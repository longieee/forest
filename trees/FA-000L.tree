\p{Let K be a [compact](FA-000H) [metric space](FA-000G). A subset of #{C(K)} is [precompact](FA-000I) if and only if it is [bounded](FA-000J), and [equicontinuous](FA-000K).}

\p{\strong{N.B} since uniform equicontinuity implies pointwise equicontinuity, the usage of "equicontious" above is unambiguous.}

\p{If that subset is closed, then it's [compact](FA-000H)}
