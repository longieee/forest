\p{A sequence #{(x_n)} in a metric space #{(X,d)} is called a Cauchy sequence if for every #{Îµ > 0}, there exists an integer #{N} such that #{d(x_m, x_n) < Îµ} for all #{m, n \geq N}.}

\p{In other words, a sequence is Cauchy if its terms get arbitrarily close to each other as the sequence progresses.}

\p{Every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, but the converse is not true unless the metric space is [complete](FA-000N).}
