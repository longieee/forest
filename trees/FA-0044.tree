\taxon{Definition}


\p{#{R \in \mathbb{R}^n} is a \strong{rectangle} if #{R} is the Cartesian product of #{n} intervals of the closed, open, or half-open form.}

\p{In measure theory, rectangles are fundamental shapes used to define measures in Euclidean space. The volume of a rectangle is simply the product of the lengths of its sides.}
