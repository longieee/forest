\taxon{Definition}


\p{An elementary set is a finite union of [rectangles](FA-0044).}

\p{In measure theory, elementary sets serve as the building blocks for constructing more complex measurable sets. They are used in the definition of both [Lebesgue outer measure](FA-003W) and [Lebesgue inner measure](FA-003X).}
