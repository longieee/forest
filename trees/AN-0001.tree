\title{Finite variation}

\p{
  A function of finite/bounded variation, also known as BV function, is a real-valued function whose \strong{[total variation](AN-0003)} is bounded (finite): the graph of a function having this property is well behaved in a precise sense
}

\p{
  If #{ \Phi  } is of finite variation and #{ f } is a continuous function, we can define the integral
  ##{
    \int _0^T f d \Phi 
  }
  as a [Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral]()
}
